        I am passionate about user research. Combining psychology and UX to conduct research and validate ideas on how people interact with applications and interfaces makes me excited for my next project.
        I was born and raised in the sunny state of Florida but currently reside in good old Kentucky. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and a certificate in UX/UI from the University of Central Florida.

            In my down time I enjoy tending to my houseplants, which I probably have way too many of. I also enjoy drawing as well, whether they are pictures for myself or my friends it’s always a good time.
